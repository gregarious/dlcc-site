<p>It is very rare for a Convention Center to promote its public art as <a href="../images/PDFs/Art_Brochure.pdf" target="_blank">Art within Art</a> but the David L. Lawrence is a very rare meeting/exhibition venue. Home to over 25 works of art, valued at $2 million, includes seven commissioned pieces that reflect the vitality, character and creative energy of the Pittsburgh Region.</p>

<p>The Convention Center’s <a href="http://www.regionalshowcase.com/" target="_blank">Regional Showcase</a> presented by Dollar Bank, is located outside of The Spirit of Pittsburgh Ballroom and showcases Southwestern Pennsylvania’s assets and amenities under such subjects as education, technology, business, healthcare, arts, culture, and lifestyle. The Regional Gallery is projected onto two parallel walls on the third floor, south of the visitor corridor. This area is a graceful, but immersive study of particular organizations, the arts, our natural surroundings, and other specific themes.</p>

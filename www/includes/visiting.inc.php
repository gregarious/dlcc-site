<p>As you plan to attend an event at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center (DLCC),  before you leave home, download our app for instant Convention Center and Pittsburgh information. The DLCC is very easy to get to by bus, train or driving. For directions & parking information, <a href="http://testsite.pittsburghcc.com/directions.php">click here</a>. Each event schedules their own food options so please check the event schedule to see if food options are available on the day of your visit. If food is not schedule, you have plenty of options, within a 15 minute walk of the DLCC, there are over 90 restaurants!</p>
 
<p>If you have an extra day or two, explore downtown Pittsburgh.   Located in Pittsburghâ€™s Cultural District, after or before your event, a host of activities are steps away -- theatres, cinemas, galleries, restaurants, sporting venues, shopping and hotels. See our Interactive Map for great ideas!</p>
 
<p>For any special questions or needs, please <a href="mailto:info@pittsburghcc.com">email us</a> and we will be glad to assist to make your visit special.</p>
